Learning the underlying dynamics of periodic and aperiodic systems evolving over space and time provides substantial challenges across scientific fields. Despite recent advances in machine learning (ML), our understanding of its limits to learning, identifying, and emulating real physical systems remains incomplete. With the increasing complexity of dynamical systems and higher power consumption, ML systems take inspiration from the complex learning mechanisms of the mammalian brain, for biologically plausible learning. As we delve into the designing of brain inspired ML systems, we deal with the challenges of the learning procedures, network sizes, energy efficiency and training complexities involved with it. Itâ€™s crucial to characterize their performance in learning and controlling unknown dynamical systems to address them. We address these issues by designing sparsity aware learning mechanisms in feedback driven recurrent neural networks (RNNs), incorporate biologically plausible neuron models, and integrate computational neuroscience to build data driven AI systems. We explore brain-inspired neuronal dynamics to build AI systems that can mimic and classify dynamical systems. We propose full-FORCE (FF) SNN, Reservoir-in-reservoir (R-i-R) architecture, and SNN based applications learning, We propose sparsity aware learning in RNNs, full-FORCE based sparsity regularization in recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNN) and an RSNN based BLE application for dynamical systems learning. Our proposed learning methods and architectures exhibit strong performance, noise robustness and energy efficiency in simulated and real-world adaptive system emulation. We evaluate bio signals, motion trajectories, Lorenz systems, real-world dynamic variable datasets, and other dynamical systems in this dissertation.
