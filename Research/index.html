				<p>If you've made it here, let's talk a bit about what I do!I work on Brain-inspired artificial intelligence, Sequential learning, and Deep learning algorithm development, with applications in nonlinear dynamical systems learning. The application areas include, but are not limited to, image classification, signal processing, speech recognition, disease prediction, screening for diseases, and other healthcare applications. My publications are available on <p><a href="https://dblp.org/pid/292/9088.html">DBLP</a><p>
